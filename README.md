> Unit 1, Project 1

## Project Objective

Technical interviews are a core component of being a data scientist. Moreover, they're a fun way to practice your new Python skills.

Below we've included five coding challenges. You should complete each of these in Python, and test your solutions to verify they work. You are encouraged to comment your code to so you can explain what is occuring at each step.

Many of these are common practice problems, which means some solutions can be found online. Students should see these questions as an opportunity to challenge themselves; looking up answers limits the potential growth that comes from practice and repetition of these skills.

## Code Challenges

> The following code challenges are drawn from common exercises used in technical interviews.

### Challenge 1: Largest Palindrome
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Challenge 2: Summation of primes
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.

### Challenge 3: Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Challenge 4: String Compressor
Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string 'aabcccccaaa' would become a2b1c5a3. If the “compressed” string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z). Specify whether your solution is case sensitive or insensitive, and what you would need to change to make it the other.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. Additionally, instructors will provide you with feedback on required portions of your project.

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Surpasses our wildest expectations!_

> Note: Scores of `2` mean that a requirement has been completely fulfilled, while `3` is typically reserved for bonus objectives.
